//using tuples for defining the types of the arguments and the return value

let User: [string, number, boolean] = ["Kelminthes", 1, true];
//this is very useful in recieving data from API calls.
//tuples makes sure, the size and order of the data is correct.

//example with rgb values
let rgb: [number, number, number] = [255, 255, 255];
